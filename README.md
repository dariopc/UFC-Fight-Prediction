# UFC-Fight-Prediction

This project uses historical UFC data—including fighter statistics, biological data, and bookmaker odds—to predict the outcome of UFC fights using machine learning. The goal is to evaluate whether ML models can outperform betting sites in predicting winners.
We explore various data preprocessing techniques and feature selection methods to identify the most influential factors in fight outcomes. Multiple ML models are trained and tested, and the best-performing models are deployed in a simulated betting strategy to assess real-world applicability.

**Research Question**
Can machine learning be used to predict UFC fight winners better than bookmakers?
